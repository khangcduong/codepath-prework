## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

An app idea I have in mind is one that is tailored for traditional painters of whichever medium. Painters can submit their palette to the app. Then as they work on mixing colors throughout the painting process, they can scan the color that they are currently working with, it will be converted to a hexcode. They can then either scan a color that they want to achieve or input its hexcode. The app will then, using AI or some other method, recommend which color(s) from their palette that they should add to the current color to achieve the intended color. It will be named PALette AI.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Currently have not begun building the app brainstormed above, but with the prework I struggled a little bit with understanding how to change text color, as there was not a built in function. Instead I had to get labels and change the colors of those.
